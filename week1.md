Finite Dimensional Distributions have symmetrical property  

Given taht $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent.  

$$
X_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)  
X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(1,2)  
P_{1,2} \sim MVN fillinblank  
P_{2,1} \sim MVN fillinblank  
$$

also Marginalization, adding a new value from Boreal set,see notes  
 - for multivariate normal removing values can be done by romoving row and column  

# what is a valid covmatrix  
 - positive definite  
 - symmetrical  

# how to prove positive definite  
 - -1 off diagnonal  
 - check your phone pics  

do you even know what a rank 1 matrix is??

# TEST!!!!
 - Look at the Lemm on page 20 of notes for Conditional independence  
 - transform each point to every other points given probability transformations  
 - pay special attention at v and vi and its usefulness for marginal distributions
